# Google Widget Redesign
A redesign of Google's code snippet widget. The original design is available on this link: https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/libraries#installing_the_client_library

I redesigned it for the instance that the number of code tabs increase, it would still be able to fit in the widget and users could easily navigate between the different tabs.

## How to run
First, clone this repository or download the code a ZIP file.
Then to run the code, navigate into the local folder on your device via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal.
Then run ```npm install``` to install all required dependencies and start the application by ```npm start```.

Below is an example of how to run on your command prompt or terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koo-eunha/google_widget_redesign.git
npm install # or yarn install
npm start  
```
