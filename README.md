# Google Widget Redesign
This project is a redesign of Google's code snippet widget using React.js. The original design is available on this link: https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/libraries#installing_the_client_library

I redesigned it for the instance that the number of code tabs increase, it would still be able to fit in the widget and users could easily navigate between the different tabs.

This project is intended for design purposes, so please note that the content is incomplete.

## How to run
First, clone this repository or download the code in a ZIP file.

Then to run the code, navigate into the cloned or downloaded local folder on your device via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal.

Then run ```npm install``` to install all required dependencies and start the application by ```npm start```.

Below is an example of how to run on your command prompt or terminal.
